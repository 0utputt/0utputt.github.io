Hello, i am Output, I am from Turkey. I like coding, mostly in LUA (Roblox). I also make UGC in roblox, using Blender. I know a bit of python, csharp.
I cannot work on my projects since roblox is banned in turkey (As i am writing this right now).

### Voxelize

Voxelize is one of my oldest roblox projects, made in 2022. The game is inspired from teardown (which is a sandbox game)
and uses voxel destruction mechanics made by myself. Although it could be a bit laggy while playing, its fun.
